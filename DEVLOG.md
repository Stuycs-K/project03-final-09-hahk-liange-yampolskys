### 2024-01-07, 2:50 PM - Merged teams and planned functionality
Revised proposal to accurately reflect new updated team and included new features like skip and looping songs. Discussed how to divide groupwork, and each member was then assigned a role.

### 2024-01-08, 2:48 PM - Started save and load functions
Created file.c and started working on save_library and load_library. Used the library.c and node.c from old project as reference and created makefile and main.c. Encountered segfault when loading library, will fix later.
